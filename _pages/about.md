Miao Jiajia, a postgraduate student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University. I graduated from the School of Journalism and Communication of Hunan University, majoring in advertising. 

In college, I was in charge of a national innovation training program and published a journal paper. Up to now, I have had three major internships and two social practice projects. I have won the honorary titles of "Provincial Outstanding Graduate", "School Merit Student", "School Outstanding Student Leader", and won the national scholarship. 

I am good at writing and event planning, and proficient in office software and new media operation software, such as Xiumi, PS and PR. In addition, I also have a certain degree of mastery of data analysis software, such as SPSS and Python.
